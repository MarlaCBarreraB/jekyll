# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely need to edit after that.
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
title: Your awesome title
email: your-email@domain.com
description: > # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
  line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for
  Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://yourdomain.com" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
twitter_username: jekyllrb
github_username:  jekyll

# The configuration file also allows you to set site-wide variables that can be
# accessed as `site.my_variable`. You'll notice in the default site layout,
# these produce branded links to the corresponding Twitter and Github account.
# The template `_include/footer.html` and `_include/icon-github.html` show you
# how to use these: just reference the site.github_username to determine what
# to include and how to construct the appropriate URLs.

# Build settings
