# This file is empty because by default, the "content" is adequately realised
# by Minima's 'home' layout.
#
# Nevertheless, feel free to customize this page as you like. Anything you
# add after the front matter dashes will be rendered and written into the
# generated "index.html". You may also alter this front matter block itself
# if you'd like to, Jekyll won't mind.
