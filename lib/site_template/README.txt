===================================
  Welcome to your new Jekyll Site
===================================

This file generated by Jekyll will neither be included in the site built
when you run `jekyll build` (or `jekyll serve`) nor will it be read by git
if you plan to have your site set up as a git repository.

For the new users of Jekyll, Welcome to Jekyll! :) The directory you just
generated is a self-sufficient blog. You should be able to view this blog
in your browser by simply running `bundle exec jekyll serve` in your
command-terminal and pointing your browser to http://localhost:4000/. For
more information on using Jekyll, go to: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/

For the experienced users of Jekyll who just recently upgraded from v3.1.x
and older, don't be confused by the missing folders in your blog. They've
been bundled together as a theme-gem called "minima", which your site will
look-up to during Jekyll's build process.
This configuration can be changed by editing the "theme: minima" line in
your "_config.yml" and the "gem 'minima', '~> 2.0'" line in your "Gemfile".
To know the path to the installed theme-gem, simply run `bundle show minima`
in your terminal.

For more information on gem-based themes, go to:
  https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/

Minima's source code is hosted on Github at:
