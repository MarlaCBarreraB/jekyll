This is a high-level roadmap for Jekyll. It is a list of things we're
planning for each release. While plans are subject to change, this should
offer a bit of an overview for anyone interested in future features.

If you'd like to discuss any of the items, visit the link next to each
item and leave us a comment! We'd love to hear your thoughts.

- [v3.2](#v32)
- [v3.3](#v33)

## v3.2

For v3.2, we're interested in shipping:

1. **Gem-based themes.** This will allow users to ship layouts, includes, and sass (to start with) in a way that is more easily consumable and versionable. ([discuss]({{ site.repository }}/issues/4510))
