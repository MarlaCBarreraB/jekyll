Usually this is done through the `jekyll` executable, which is installed with the gem. In order to get a server up and running with your Jekyll site, run:

`jekyll --server`

and then browse to http://0.0.0.0:4000. There's plenty of [configuration options](../configuration) available to you as well.

On Debian or Ubuntu, you may need to add `/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/` to your path.

### Base-URL Options

If you are using base-url option like `jekyll --server --base-url '/blog'` then make sure that you access the site at `http://localhost:4000/blog/index.html`. Just accessing `http://localhost:4000/blog` will not work.
