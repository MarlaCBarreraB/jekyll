Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a
template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it
through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a
complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your
favorite web server. This is also the engine behind [GitHub
Pages](http://pages.github.com), which you can use to host your
projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.
