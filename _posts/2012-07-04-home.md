This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to Jekyll. We’ll cover everything from getting your site up and running, creating and managing your content, customizing the way your site works and looks, deploying to various environments, as well as some advice on participating in the future development of Jekyll itself.

## So what is Jekyll, exactly?

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (or [Textile](http://textile.sitemonks.com/)) and [Liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org/) converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers **for free**.

## Quick-start guide

For the impatient, here's how to get Jekyll up and running.

{% highlight %}
~ $ gem install jekyll
~ $ mkdir -p my/new/site
~ $ cd my/new/site
~ $ vim index.html
~/my/new/site $ jekyll --server
# => Now browse to http://localhost:4000
{% endhighlight %}

That's nothing though. The real magic happens when you start creating posts, using the front-matter to conrol templates and layouts, and taking advantage of all the awesome configuration options Jekyll makes available.
