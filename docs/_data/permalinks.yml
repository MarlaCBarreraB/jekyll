      The specified categories for this post. If a post has multiple categories, Jekyll will create

      double slashes in the URLs, so if no categories are present, it will ignore this.

      The specified categories for this post but <em>slugified</em>. If a category is a composite of

      with a hyphen. (e.g. <code>"Work 2 Progress"</code> will be converted into
      <code>"work-2-progress"</code>). If a post has multiple categories, Jekyll will create
      a hierarchy (e.g. <code>/work-2-progress/category2</code>). Also Jekyll automatically parses
      out double slashes in the URLs, so if no categories are present, it will ignore this.
