- key: categories
  description: >-
    The specified categories for this post. If a post has multiple categories, Jekyll will create a hierarchy
    (e.g. <code>/category1/category2</code>). Also Jekyll automatically parses out double slashes in the URLs,
    so if no categories are present, it will ignore this.
- key: slugified_categories
  required_version: "4.1"
  description: >-
    The specified categories for this post but <em>slugified</em>. If a category is a composite of multiple words, Jekyll will downcase
    all alphabets and replace any non-alphanumeric character with a hyphen. (e.g. <code>"Work 2 Progress"</code> will be converted
    into <code>"work-2-progress"</code>). If a post has multiple categories, Jekyll will create a hierarchy
    (e.g. <code>/work-2-progress/category2</code>). Also Jekyll automatically parses out double slashes in the URLs, so if no categories
    are present, it will ignore this.
