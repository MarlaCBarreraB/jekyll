Upgrading from an older version of Jekyll? A few things have changed in Jekyll 4
that you'll want to know about.

Before we dive in, you need to have at least Ruby 2.3.0 installed. Run the following
in your terminal to check

```sh
ruby -v
```

If you're using Ruby >= 2.3.0, go ahead and fetch the latest version of Jekyll:

```sh
gem update jekyll
```

### Exclusion changes

We've enhanced our default exclusion array. It now looks like the following:

```yaml
# default excludes
exclude:
- .sass-cache/
- .jekyll-cache/
- gemfiles/
- Gemfile
- Gemfile.lock
- node_modules/
- vendor/bundle/
- vendor/cache/
- vendor/gems/
- vendor/ruby/
```

What's new is that this array **does not get overridden by the `exclude` array
in the user's config file anymore**. The user's exclude entries simply get
**added** to the above default array (if the entry isn't already excluded).

To forcibly "process" directories or files that have been excluded, list them
in the `include` array instead:

```yaml
# overrides your excluded items configuration and the default include array ([".htaccess"])
include:
  - .htaccess
  - node_modules/uglifier/index.js
```

The above configuration directs Jekyll to handle only `node_modules/uglifier/index.js`
while ignoring every other file in the `node_modules` directory since that directory is
"excluded" by default.

Note that the default `include` array still gets overridden by the `include` array in your
config file. So, be sure to add `.htaccess` to the list if you need that file to be
present in the generated site.
