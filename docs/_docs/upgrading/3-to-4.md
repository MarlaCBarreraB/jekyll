Upgrading from an older version of Jekyll? A few things have changed in Jekyll 4
that you'll want to know about.

Before we dive in, you need to have at least Ruby 2.3.0 installed. Run the following
in your terminal to check

```sh
ruby -v
```

If you're using Ruby >= 2.3.0, go ahead and fetch the latest version of Jekyll:

```sh
gem update jekyll
```

### Exclusion & Inclusion changes

We've enhanced our default exclusion array. It now looks like the following:

```
.sass-cache/
.jekyll-cache/
gemfiles/
Gemfile
Gemfile.lock
node_modules/
vendor/bundle/
vendor/cache/
vendor/gems/
vendor/ruby/
```

What's new is that this array __cannot be overriden anymore__. You can forcibly include
directories or files that have been excluded by default, though. This would look like this:

```yml
include:
  - node_modules/.bin/**
  
# This only includes every file and directory in `node_modules/.bin`, but still excludes the rest.
```
