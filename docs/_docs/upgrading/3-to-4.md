Upgrading from an older version of Jekyll? A few things have changed in Jekyll 4
that you'll want to know about.

Before we dive in, you need to have at least Ruby 2.3.0 installed. Run the following
in your terminal to check

```sh
ruby -v
```

If you're using Ruby >= 2.3.0, go ahead and fetch the latest version of Jekyll:

```sh
gem update jekyll
```


### Template rendering

We've slightly altered the way Jekyll parses and renders your various templates to improve
the overall build times. Jekyll now parses a template once, caches it internally and then
renders the parsed template multiple times as required by your pages and documents.

The downside to this is that some of the community-authored plugins may not work as they
previously used to.

#### For Plugin-authors

* If your plugin depends on the following code: `site.liquid_renderer.file(path).parse(content)`,
note that the return value (`template`, an instance of *`Liquid::Template`*), from that line will
always be the **same object** for a given `path`. <br/>
The *`template`* instance is then rendered as previously, with respect to the `payload` passed to it.
You'll therefore have to ensure that *`payload`* is not memoized or cached in your plugin instance.

* If its a requirement that `template` you get from the above step *be different* at all times,
you can invoke *`Liquid::Template`* directly:


  ```diff
  - template = site.liquid_renderer.file(path).parse(content)
  + template = Liquid::Template.parse(content)
  ```


### kramdown v2

Jekyll has dropped support for `kramdown-1.x` entirely.

From [`v2.0` onwards](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/news.html#kramdown-200-released) kramdown requires
specific extensions to be additionally installed to use certain features are desired outside of kramdown's
core functionality.

Out of all the extensions listed in the report linked above, gem `kramdown-parser-gfm` is automatically
installed along with Jekyll 4.0. The remaining extensions will have to be manually installed by the user
depending on desired funtionality, by listing the extension's gem-name in their `Gemfile`.

Notes:
  * `kramdown-converter-pdf` will be ignored by Jekyll Core. Use a third-party plugin to convert
    Markdown to PDF.
  * Vendors that provide a versioned Jekyll Environment Image (e.g. Docker Image, GitHub Pages, etc)
    will have to manually whitelist kramdown's extension gems in their distributions for Jekyll 4.0.
