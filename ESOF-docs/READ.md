#**First report of ESOF - Jekyll** 		

Jekyll is a static website generator in open source developed in Ruby (among other languages), which uses template directories and it is able to read several files with diferent text files(Markdown, Liquid, HTML and CSS). It allows you to create a website where your content is what matters most, easy to use and understand. Jekyll is not a blogging software, it is a parsing device. GitHub pages are powered by Jekyll so you can easily deploy your website usig GitHub.

##Why prefer Jekyll?

* Ability to write content in markdown or textile in your favorite text-editor.
* Ability to write and preview your content via localhost.
* No internet connection required.
* Ability to publish via git.
* Ability to host your blog on a static web-server.
* Ability to host freely on GitHub Pages.
* No database required.


##Languages used to date(percentages):

5. Shell (1.2 %)
	* A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by a command line interpreter

####Number of contributors to date: 483

####Number of releases to date: 82

####Number of branches to date: 21


##Development methods:

Jekyll is based in the *GitHub Flow* method which has similarities with *Agile*.
It allows the team to focus in different features since it is based in producing the code in diferent branches. Every master branch is deployable, so it's extremely important that your new branch is created off of master when working on a feature or a fix.

We sent several emails to Jekyll main contributors and posted on the official Jekyll's forum and we got a reply from *parkr* where he explains their use of *GitHub Flow*. Quoting his answer: "We use GitHub Flow to collaborate on code, with heavy use of labels. Our releases are mostly arbitrary".
We also asked about his reusage of code and he said they reuse multiple code via RubyGems dependencies. 


##Our understarnding

In what regards to Jekyll, we believe that the *GitHub Flow* method is a good method to be used. This method allows multiple features and bug fixes at the same time due to the branching method. In spite of this, the better method would be *Agile with Scrum* but since they cannot assemble proper team gatherings, it becomes problematic to implement it. *Agile* would make it easier to share and divide the work among the team and it would figure out the time spent to a certain feature accomplishment. This would make their releases more profitable because they would know better when they should do them.
