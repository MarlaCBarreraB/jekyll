#**First report of ESOF**		

Jekyll is a static website generator in open source developed in Ruby (among other languages), which uses template directories and it is able to read several files with diferent text files(Markdown, Liquid, HTML and CSS). It allows you to create a website where your content is what matters most, easy to use and understand. Jekyll is not a blogging software, it is a parsing device. GitHub pages are powered by Jekyll so you can easily deploy your website usig GitHub.

##Why prefer Jekyll?

* Ability to write content in markdown or textile in your favorite text-editor.
* Ability to write and preview your content via localhost.
* No internet connection required.
* Ability to publish via git.
* Ability to host your blog on a static web-server.
* Ability to host freely on GitHub Pages.
* No database required.

##Development methods:

Jekyll is based in the waterfall method since it only has 2 major contributors. It allows to focus more in each task and complete it before moving to the next step. 

The project planning for Jekyll should look something like:

1. Conceiving idea of what is intended
2. Design
3. Code and unit test
4. Perform system testing
5. Perform user acceptance testing
6. Fix any issues
7. Deliver the finished product

In a Waterfall project each of these represent diferent software stages. The project progress is easier to measure and test scripts can be written while the actual code is still underway. 
But some changes to the features of the project itself might be difficult to perform since the is already code on top of it and some bugs are more dificult to fix because they are detected in a late state of the project. 

In what regards to Jekyll, we believe that the Waterfall method is what most favors it, since it is mostly coded by 2 contributors(parkr and mojombo, parkr being the master with more than 2000 commits). The project direction will never change to the point of having major trouble in features implementation.
